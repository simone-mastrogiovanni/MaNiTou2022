The selection function is a crucial component for any \"population analysis\" of the GWTC-2 binary black hole population.\n",

    "1. Generated a large number of synthetic binary black hole signals with parameters drawn randomly from a distribution (specified below) over black hole masses, black hole spins, redshift, orientation, etc, etc.  The total number of signals generated is recorded in the data product (see below).\n",
    "1. Removed any generated signals whose estimated S/N in the detectors fell below a very low threshold (these are \"hopeless\" for detection in any case).\n",
    "1. Injected the remaining signals into the O3a data stream (in software!) at uniform intervals in time.\n",
    "1. Re-searched the modified O3a data stream with the same pipelines used to produce the GWTC-2 catalog and recorded for each injected signal the inverse false alarm rate (a measure of detection significance) calculated in each pipeline.\n",
    "1. Produced a data file containing the parameters, detection statistics, and the properly-normalized probability density of the draw distribution for every synthetic BBH signal not removed in step 2.\n",

    "Given a detection statistic threshold, counting the number of injections in the file above the threshold and dividing by the total number of signals generated gives a Monte-Carlo estimate of the *fraction* of the generated population that is detectable by our searches above that threshold.  The fraction of detectable signals from a different population can be estimated by applying weights, given by the ratio between the different population's probability density and the injected population's density, before counting detected injections.  \n",
